# Concluding Remarks

- **Vue** offers a very intuitive and integrated approach to reactivity with its computed properties, watchers, and the clear separation between reactive state and UI.
- **React** takes a more functional approach where state is managed via hooks. Its reactivity is less “magical” in that you explicitly declare state and side effects, relying on a Virtual DOM for efficient updates.
- **Angular** uses a mix of declarative binding in templates alongside a powerful change detection mechanism supported by Zone.js and lifecycle hooks. Its approach is more opinionated, encouraging structured component classes and often leveraging RxJS for data streams and reactivity.
